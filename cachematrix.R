## defines a list of 4 functions (methods) to be used to cache a matrix and the inverse of that matrix 

## 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {  ##accepts as input a square matrix to be inverted
        i <- NULL    ##assigns i holds the inverted matrix.
        
        set <- function(y) {  ## first method "set", allows the stored matrix, x, to be overwritten with matrix y.  Not used in Programming Assignment 2  
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL  ## inverse matrix set to NULL, indicating that it has to be calculated  
        }
        
        
        get <- function() x  ## returns the original matrix
        
        setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse  ##uses i to store the inverse matrix which is passed in "inverse".  Superassignment required as i
                                                        ## is a variable defined in parent environmentp$
        
        getinverse <- function() i  # returns the cached matrix in i
        
        
        list(set = set, get = get,  ##returns the list of functions to be called as methods of the object created by makeCacheMatrix a 
             setinverse = setinverse, ## and establishes "x" and "i" to hold the original matrix and its inverse if it has been calculated
             getinverse = getinverse)  ## it does no calculation, it just stores and retrieves results and maintains those values in its parent environment 
}


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        ##cacheSolve accepts x, an object with 4 methods (set,get,setinverse, getinverse), that was generated by the makeCacheMatrix function 
        j <- x$getinverse()## if inverse exists then return it in j of NULL 
        if(!is.null(j)) {##if inverse has been calculated been calculated ie variable isnt NULL
                message("getting cached data")
                return(j) ##then pring it out and stop
        }
        data <- x$get()  ##otherwise get the input matrix 
        j <- solve(data) ##calculate the inverse matrix
        x$setinverse(j)  ## store it in the original object
        j}  #print inverse
